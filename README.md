# Things I learned from this project.

- taking a more object oriented approach.
- seperating logic into files in order to make code more manageable.
- using export and import.
- extending classes, classes that extend another class have access to that objects properties and/or methods.
- object destructuring.
- create a visual representation when stuck.
