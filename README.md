# Things I learned from this project.

- taking a more object oriented approach.
- seperating logic into files in order to make code more manageable.
- using export and import.
- classes that share the same methods or functionality can cause you to repeat yourself, instead encapsulate those functions and properties into another class which other classes can share.
- extending classes, classes that extend another class have access to that objects properties and/or methods, calling super() to call parent constructor.
- object destructuring.
- using default parameters.
- create a visual representation when stuck.
- dont hardcode strings that you use in multiple parts, instead store that string in a variable so if changes are needed you only have to update the variable rather than updating every single string.

# Next steps

# TODO:

- change hardcoded numbers to a variable.
- make game start on a key press and restrart when player loses.
- fix double collision when ball hits more than one block.
- add powers.
